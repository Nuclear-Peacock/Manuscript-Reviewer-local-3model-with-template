Radiopharmaceutical nomenclature style guide
1) Preferred terminology (use these words)
1.1 Radiopharmaceutical, radioligand
Radiopharmaceutical: the preferred umbrella term for radioactive pharmaceutical substances administered for imaging or therapy (e.g., [18F]FDG, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617).
Radioligand: acceptable when specifically describing a ligand–target (e.g., receptor/antigen-binding) agent; if used, it must still follow all radionuclide naming rules below.
1.2 Replace “radiotracer” and “tracer”
Replace radiotracer with radiopharmaceutical (preferred) or radioligand (when ligand–target context is central).
Do not use tracer alone (ambiguous). If you mean the administered agent, write radiopharmaceutical (or radioligand).
1.3 Radioactivity vs activity (measurements)
Radioactivity is the spontaneous decay (nuclear transformation) of unstable nuclei with emission of ionizing radiation (particles and/or photons); it is a phenomenon/property, not the quantitative measurement.
Use activity for the quantity you measure, and report it in Bq (with pre-SI units such as mCi/Ci only in parentheses if included).
1.4 Avoid jargon
Do not use hot/cold for radioactive/nonradioactive; write radioactive and nonradioactive.
2) How to write radionuclides and radiopharmaceutical names
2.1 When the radionuclide is part of a named compound (square brackets)
In a radiopharmaceutical name, place the radionuclide descriptor in square brackets immediately before the compound name or chemical formula:
[AE]Compound (A is the mass number and E is the elemental symbol)
No hyphen between the bracketed radionuclide and the compound name.
Examples:
[18F]FDG
[223Ra]RaCl2
[99mTc]NaTcO4
Do not write: 18F-FDG, F-18 FDG, [18F]-FDG.
2.2 Radiometal-containing radiopharmaceuticals (chelator/complex-based)
When the radionuclide is a metal, the metal element symbol must appear in the compound name (because the chelator/ligand itself does not contain the metal):
Correct: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-TATE, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, [99mTc]Tc-DTPA
Incorrect: [68Ga]PSMA-11, [64Cu]DOTA-TATE, [99mTc]DTPA, 99mTc-DTPA
2.3 When the radionuclide is mentioned alone in running text (spell out)
If the radionuclide is mentioned in isolation (not as part of a compound name), spell it out as element–mass number:
fluorine-18, carbon-11, gallium-68, technetium-99m
Example:
“The radioisotope present in [18F]FDG is fluorine-18.”
Don’t use shorthand forms in prose (e.g., 18F, F-18, Tc-99m, 99mTc) when the radioisotope is being referenced as the subject.
2.4 Typesetting
Mass numbers should be superscripted in typeset text (e.g., ¹⁸F, ⁶⁸Ga, ⁹⁹ᵐTc).
2.5 Abbreviations in radiopharmaceutical names (do not spell out)
In the radiopharmaceutical name itself, retain widely accepted abbreviations/acronyms for common compounds, targets, and building blocks.
Use: [18F]FDG, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617
Do not write the full chemical/biologic expansion in the name (e.g., avoid [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose or [68Ga]Ga–prostate-specific membrane antigen… as a name).
If needed for reader clarity, spell out an abbreviation once in running text at first mention, then continue using the abbreviation.
Preserve standard capitalization (e.g., FDG, PSMA, DOTA where applicable).
3) Hyphens and what not to bracket
3.1 Use hyphens for processes/descriptors (no brackets)
Rule: Reserve square brackets for radiopharmaceutical names/formulae. Do not use square brackets when describing a process, descriptor, or attribute.
Correct:
18F-fluorination
11C-labeling
68Ga-labeled (as an adjective)
“fluorine-18 labeling” (prose alternative)
Incorrect:
[18F]fluorination
[11C]labeling
[68Ga]labeled
3.2 Use hyphens to join metal + ligand name when the ligand does not otherwise contain the metal
For radiometal-containing agents, connect the metal element symbol to the remainder of the name with a hyphen.
Examples: [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, [99mTc]Tc-DTPA, [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-TATE
Reminder: Do not omit the metal element symbol (e.g., avoid [68Ga]PSMA-11).
4) Quick reference (Do/Don’t)
Do
[18F]FDG
[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617
fluorine-18 (radionuclide alone)
18F-fluorination / fluorine-18 labeling (process)
Use radiopharmaceutical (preferred) or radioligand (when appropriate)
Don’t
18F-FDG, F-18 FDG, [18F]-FDG
[68Ga]PSMA-11 (missing metal symbol)
[18F]fluorination / [11C]labeling (brackets used for a process)
radiotracer (replace with radiopharmaceutical/radioligand)
tracer (do not use alone)
hot/cold (use radioactive/nonradioactive)
