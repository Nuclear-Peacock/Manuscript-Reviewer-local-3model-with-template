Use:
- Evidence pack (sentences with pointers)
- EQUATOR guideline selection + Methods compliance assessment
- Novelty/reference check results (if provided)
- FIGURE NOTES from Qwen2.5-VL (if provided)
- Nuclear nomenclature guide (if applicable)

REVIEWER TEMPLATE (Original Research) — INTERNAL scaffold only:
{reviewer_template_excerpt}

TEMPLATE USE RULE (critical)
- Use the reviewer template as an INTERNAL checklist and reasoning scaffold only.
- Do NOT output a question-by-question or form-like Q&A.
- Do NOT mirror the template’s wording as a list of questions.
- Instead, synthesize: identify what matters most, raise only the most relevant questions, and write like a human peer reviewer.

OUTPUT FORMAT (Issue Log) — narrative reviewer voice (not Q&A)
A) 3–4 sentence synopsis (paraphrased)
B) Key Details for Original Research (if applicable): Novelty / Rationale / Analysis quality / Clarity of results (Yes/No/Unclear + 1–2 sentences)
C) Strengths (3–6 bullets)
D) Issues to address (numbered). For each: [Severity=Fatal|Major|Moderate|Minor] Issue → Why it matters → Evidence pointer(s) → What is missing → Concrete fix.
E) Missing Info Requests (5–12)
F) Reporting Guideline Checklist Gaps (EQUATOR-selected): missing items as actionable edits
G) Ethics/Bias/Reproducibility flags
H) Nomenclature audit (if applicable): incorrect term → preferred correction → pointer
I) NOVELTY signals + missing key references
J) FIGURE NOTES (if available): numbered by figure/table, each tagged Fatal/Major/Moderate/Minor
