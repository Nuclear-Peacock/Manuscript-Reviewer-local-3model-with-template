**Final Answer:**

The manuscript explores the integration of AI in PET/CT triage and a resident education module using synthetic data. While it presents promising results, such as improved diagnostic accuracy and educational outcomes, several areas need refinement for robustness and clarity.

**Strengths:**
1. Demonstrates potential workflow benefits and educational impact.
2. Provides clear AUROC values and calibration results.
3. Highlights the use of synthetic data to test AI triage, which could be novel in context.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Methodological Clarity:**
   - Expand on inclusion/exclusion criteria and imaging protocols for better reproducibility.
   - Standardize radiopharmaceutical nomenclature (e.g., "FDG" instead of "FDG tracer").

2. **Statistical Rigor:**
   - Report confidence intervals for sensitivity/specificity.
   - Address potential data leakage risks and missing data handling.

3. **Education Study Design:**
   - Include a control group and provide sample size justification.
   - Describe the validity of the pre/post test to ensure reliable results.

4. **Results Presentation:**
   - Clarify threshold selection for sensitivity/specificity in Table 2.
   - Provide distribution checks and effect sizes for education outcomes.

5. **Discussion Enhancement:**
   - Address limitations such as selection bias, protocol variability, and generalizability.
   - Better position the study against prior work, especially regarding synthetic data use.

6. **References and Figures:**
   - Ensure complete citations and provide more context in Figure 2 about external validation sites.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- Acknowledge potential biases in synthetic dataset creation despite no patient consent issues.

By addressing these areas, the manuscript can better support its claims and contribute meaningfully to the field of AI in nuclear medicine education and triage.
