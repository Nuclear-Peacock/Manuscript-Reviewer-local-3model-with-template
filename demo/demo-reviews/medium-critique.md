**Review Summary:**

The manuscript presents a synthetic study evaluating an AI triage system for PET/CT scans and a resident education module. While the concept is innovative, several critical issues undermine its scientific rigor and clarity.

**Strengths:**
- Demonstrates potential efficiency gains with AI in radiology workflows.
- Provides a structured approach to evaluating both diagnostic performance and educational impact.
- Includes external validation of the AI model, enhancing real-world applicability.

**Issues to Address:**

1. **Methodological Transparency (Severity: Major)**
   - The manuscript lacks detailed information on how repeated studies per patient were managed, potentially introducing bias or data leakage.
   - Missing details on handling missing data could affect the study's validity and reproducibility.

2. **Inconsistent Terminology (Severity: Moderate)**
   - Inconsistent naming of radiopharmaceuticals may confuse readers and hinder replication efforts.
   - Preferred correction: Use standardized nomenclature, e.g., "FDG" instead of "FDG tracer."

3. **Education Study Design (Severity: Major)**
   - The absence of a control group in the pre/post study design limits the ability to attribute observed improvements solely to the intervention.
   - Missing details on assessment validity and lack of effect size reporting reduce confidence in educational outcomes.

4. **Statistical Reporting (Severity: Moderate)**
   - Failure to report confidence intervals for sensitivity/specificity undermines the precision of these metrics.
   - Omission of effect sizes for education outcomes hinders understanding of practical significance.

5. **Discussion Limitations (Severity: Major)**
   - The discussion inadequately addresses key limitations such as selection bias, protocol variability, and generalizability.
   - Insufficient comparison to prior work weakens the manuscript's contribution to existing literature.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

- Provide detailed methodology on data handling and missing data management.
- Standardize radiopharmaceutical terminology throughout the manuscript.
- Consider adding a control group or discussing alternative explanations for educational improvements.
- Report confidence intervals and effect sizes to enhance statistical transparency.
- Expand the discussion to thoroughly address study limitations and situate findings within existing research.

**Conclusion:**

While the manuscript offers valuable insights into AI triage and education, addressing these issues will strengthen its scientific rigor and clarity.
