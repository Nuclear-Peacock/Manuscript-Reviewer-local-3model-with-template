**Synopsis**
The submitted manuscript presents a synthetic study on an AI model for PET/CT triage and its impact on resident education, showing promising results with high AUROC values and improved interpretation times and resident test scores. However, several methodological and reporting issues were identified that need to be addressed to enhance the manuscript's validity and generalizability. Key concerns include inadequate methodology, statistical flaws, educational assessment limitations, and reporting gaps. The study's discussion also lacks a thorough addressing of limitations and proper contextualization of novelty claims.

**Overall Recommendation**
Major revisions are required to address the identified issues. The manuscript has potential but needs significant improvements in methodology, statistics, and reporting transparency to ensure the results are reliable and generalizable. With thorough revisions, the study could provide valuable insights into the use of AI in PET/CT triage and resident education.

**Key Details for Original Research**
- **Novelty**: The manuscript claims novelty but lacks proper positioning against prior work, necessitating a more thorough literature review to contextualize its contributions.
- **Rationale**: The rationale for using an AI model in PET/CT triage is sound, given the potential for improved efficiency and accuracy.
- **Analysis quality**: The analysis is compromised by methodological flaws, including inadequate inclusion/exclusion criteria, incomplete imaging protocols, and potential data leakage in the AI model's training.
- **Clarity of results**: Results are presented with some clarity but lack comprehensive statistical reporting, including confidence intervals and effect sizes.

**Required Revisions**
### Major Revisions
1. **Methodology Enhancement**: Provide detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria for the retrospective cohort and complete imaging protocols to enhance reproducibility and reduce selection bias.
2. **Statistical Corrections**: Include confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity, justify sample size, and adjust for multiple comparisons in subgroup analyses to ensure statistical robustness.
3. **Educational Assessment Improvement**: Incorporate a control group into the pre/post design and provide validity evidence for assessments to strengthen the educational impact analysis.

### Minor Revisions
1. **Reporting Enhancements**: Add error bars/confidence intervals to figures and complete tables to improve transparency and readability.
2. **Nomenclature Consistency**: Ensure consistent radiopharmaceutical naming throughout the manuscript.

**Section-by-Section Notes**
- **Abstract**: Should be revised to reflect any changes made in response to the major revisions, particularly ensuring that claims of novelty are accurately represented.
- **Introduction**: Needs a more thorough literature review to properly contextualize the study's contributions and claims of novelty.
- **Methods**: Must be expanded to include detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria, complete imaging protocols, and addressing of potential data leakage in the AI model's training.
- **Results**: Should include comprehensive statistical reporting, such as confidence intervals for key metrics and effect sizes.
- **Discussion**: Requires a strengthened discussion of limitations, including selection bias, protocol variability, and the implications of these on the study's findings.
- **Tables/Figures**: Need enhancement with error bars/confidence intervals and completion of any incomplete data to improve clarity and transparency.
- **References**: Placeholder references should be completed, and citations should be checked for accuracy and consistency.

**Reporting Guideline Checklist Gaps**
The manuscript lacks adherence to several key reporting guidelines, including detailed methodology descriptions, comprehensive statistical analysis, and transparent reporting of study limitations. Specifically, the STARD guideline for diagnostic accuracy studies and the CONSORT extension for trials of non-pharmacological interventions should be consulted to ensure compliance.

**Ethics, Bias, Reproducibility**
The study's retrospective design and potential for selection bias introduce ethical concerns regarding patient privacy and the generalizability of findings. The discussion should address these issues more thoroughly, including how biases were mitigated and the implications for reproducibility.
