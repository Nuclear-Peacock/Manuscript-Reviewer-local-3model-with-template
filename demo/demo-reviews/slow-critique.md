**Review of Synthetic Manuscript on AI-Assisted PET/CT Triage and Resident Education**

The manuscript presents a synthetic study evaluating an AI model for PET/CT triage and its impact on resident education. While the study demonstrates promising results with an AUROC of 0.91 internally and 0.87 externally, along with improved interpretation times and resident test scores, several methodological and reporting issues need addressing.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Inadequate Methodology:**
   - The retrospective cohort lacks detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria, potentially introducing selection bias.
   - Imaging protocols are incomplete, affecting reproducibility.
   - Data leakage in the AI model's training could inflate performance metrics.

2. **Statistical Concerns:**
   - Missing confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity.
   - No sample size justification or multiple comparison adjustments in subgroup analyses.

3. **Educational Assessment Flaws:**
   - Pre/post design without a control group, making it difficult to attribute improvements to the intervention.
   - Lack of validity evidence for assessments and effect size reporting.

4. **Reporting Gaps:**
   - Sparse details on external validation sites and subgroup performance.
   - Missing error bars/confidence intervals in figures and incomplete tables.

5. **Discussion Limitations:**
   - Inadequate addressing of limitations like selection bias and protocol variability.
   - Claims of novelty without proper positioning against prior work.

6. **References and Nomenclature:**
   - Placeholder references with incomplete citations.
   - Inconsistent radiopharmaceutical naming requiring nomenclature checks.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

- Provide detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria and imaging protocols.
- Address data leakage and missing data handling in the AI model.
- Include control groups and validity evidence for educational assessments.
- Report comprehensive statistics, including effect sizes and multiple comparisons.
- Enhance transparency in external validation details and subgroup analyses.
- Strengthen discussion of limitations and properly contextualize novelty claims.
- Complete references and ensure consistent nomenclature.

Addressing these issues will enhance the manuscript's clarity, validity, and generalizability.
