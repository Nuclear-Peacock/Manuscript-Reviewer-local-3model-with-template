### Synopsis
The submitted manuscript presents a synthetic study evaluating an AI triage system for PET/CT scans alongside a resident education module, showcasing potential efficiency gains in radiology workflows through structured approaches to diagnostic performance and educational impact evaluation. However, several critical methodological and reporting issues detract from the manuscript's scientific rigor and clarity. The study highlights innovative applications of AI but requires significant revisions to enhance validity, reproducibility, and comparability with existing literature. Key areas for improvement include methodological transparency, consistent terminology, education study design, statistical reporting, and discussion of limitations.

### Overall Recommendation
Major revisions are required to address the identified issues that compromise the manuscript's scientific integrity and readability. The necessary changes include enhancing methodological details, standardizing terminology, improving study design, bolstering statistical analysis, and expanding the discussion to adequately cover limitations and contextualize findings within current research. Upon addressing these concerns, the manuscript has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field of AI applications in radiology and medical education.

### Key Details for Original Research
- **Novelty**: The integration of an AI triage system with a resident education module presents a novel approach to enhancing both diagnostic efficiency and educational outcomes in radiology.
- **Rationale**: The study is well-motivated by the need for improved efficiency and accuracy in PET/CT scan interpretations, as well as the importance of effective resident education in radiology.
- **Analysis Quality**: While the study demonstrates potential, its analysis is compromised by methodological flaws, including inadequate handling of repeated studies per patient and missing data, which could introduce bias.
- **Clarity of Results**: The presentation of results lacks precision due to the omission of confidence intervals for key metrics like sensitivity and specificity, and the failure to report effect sizes for educational outcomes.

### Required Revisions
#### Major Revisions
1. **Enhance Methodological Transparency**: Provide detailed information on managing repeated studies per patient and handling missing data to ensure study validity and reproducibility.
2. **Improve Education Study Design**: Consider adding a control group to the pre/post study design or discuss alternative explanations for observed educational improvements to strengthen causal inferences.
3. **Address Discussion Limitations**: Thoroughly discuss key limitations, including selection bias, protocol variability, and generalizability, and compare findings with prior work to contextualize the manuscript's contribution.

#### Minor Revisions
1. **Standardize Radiopharmaceutical Terminology**: Use standardized nomenclature (e.g., "FDG" instead of "FDG tracer") throughout the manuscript for clarity and replicability.
2. **Enhance Statistical Reporting**: Report confidence intervals for sensitivity/specificity and include effect sizes for education outcomes to improve statistical transparency and understanding of practical significance.

### Section-by-Section Notes
- **Abstract**: Ensure that the abstract accurately reflects the study's methodology, main findings, and limitations.
- **Introduction**: Clarify the rationale behind combining AI triage with resident education and highlight the novelty of this approach.
- **Methods**: Adhere strictly to reporting guidelines, providing detailed methodologies for data handling, missing data management, and study design.
- **Results**: Present results with precision, including confidence intervals and effect sizes where applicable.
- **Discussion**: Expand the discussion to cover limitations, compare findings with existing literature, and discuss implications for practice and future research.
- **Tables and Figures**: Ensure that all tables and figures are clearly labeled, properly referenced in the text, and adhere to journal formatting guidelines. Specifically, address figure notes as outlined in the provided FIGURE NOTES section.

### Reporting Guideline Checklist Gaps
The manuscript lacks adherence to several EQUATOR guidelines, particularly in terms of study design transparency, statistical reporting, and discussion of limitations. Ensuring compliance with these guidelines will significantly enhance the manuscript's quality and reproducibility.

### Ethics, Bias, Reproducibility
Addressing the identified methodological issues, such as handling repeated studies per patient and missing data, is crucial for reducing bias and enhancing reproducibility. Additionally, discussing study limitations and potential biases in the discussion section will improve transparency and ethical reporting practices.
